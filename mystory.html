        <p style="padding:10px; font-size: x-large; text-align: justify; font-family: 'Indie Flower', cursive;">This is a story of how I fell in love with Meera - a fictional name for a non-fictional character and the most beautiful person on earth. 
        <br><br>
        I am a 26 year old part of the common folk born and brought up in Mumbai, the City of Dreams - Oh yeah...I am one of those dreamers of the day. I want to do many things in life - play music,
        connect with people, explore the world, go out on adventures, romance - the first of which is to find myself.
        <br><br>
        There was a really interesting post on IG that says - "Everyone has two lives, the second one begins when you realize you have only one" If I were to put an average number to that realization time, I would say that mostly at the age of 25, people wake up when a quintessential portion of their life has passed by and they get a choice...whether to keep living the same life or make efforts to change it.
        <br><br>
        So, I wake up one fine day on my journey from 24 to 25, quit my IT job and decide to pursue music, fall in love and more importantly act on it, yes, yes...in those long 25 years, I never once confessed my love to anyone apart from my didi, oh btw my didi is the most beautiful person of my universe, but that story is for another time. 
        <br><br>
        My big idea to pursue music was to put my drumkit on the rooftop of our apartment and practice, not gig, not connect with other musicians but practice, not earn, just practice and 3 months into "practice", I realized...well that's not enough. So, I auditioned for an institue where "a legendary musician" taught drums, he liked me and they took me. Never in my life had I imagined that I would be in a music school, my parents reluctantly agreed and I got in...it was easy. I've used that word 'easy' for a very particular reason...I will come to that later.
        <br><br>
        And yes I ventured out, quit my job to pursue music and fall in love...easy, right? While waiting for my first day of music school, I did a bunch of other things - started training in mixed martial arts, did strength training, there was that rooftop gig everyday for..umm..lets's say four hours, all while recovering from a heartbreak...wait... I think I mentioned that I've never confessed my love up until this point in my life...while that maybe true, you don't really need to confess to get your heart broken...so yeah it happens. It was around before this time that I wrote "Khaali Panne" - a song on anticipatory heartbreak, if that's a thing...hehe...I'm going to lead a sad and pathetic life, aren't I?
        <br><br>
        Ofcourse, I do not 'plan' to fall in love, it's something I will allow myself to do. So, here comes the first day of music school, we are called for the orientation. I am dressed formally, all excited and catch a train to 'go to school'. I exit the train one stop before the actual destination in hopes of getting a rickshaw and easily commuting to the college building as it would be a 10 minute walk otherwise. What I thought to be an easy 5 min cab ride turned out to be a 30 minute walk to school as all rickshaw-walas denied me. So, I enter our school building sweating through half of my shirt and found the orientation room. I walked in the second row of the seating, asked the lady adjacent to me whether the seat was occupied and took the seat as no one was expected there. That's where I first met Meera.
        <br><br>
        The name Meera has mytholigical importance. Meera, also known as Meera Bai or Mirabai, had a natural love and devotion for Lord Krishna and she showed her dedication in the form of songs and poetry. Ofcourse, I can't even begin to compare myself to such an omnipresent being for I am only human and I make a lot of mistakes...I can only hope to fix my mistakes. Anyway, there was a reason for choosing that name and I thought I should mention it.
        <br><br>
        So, on our first day, we talked about music, education...I remember telling her that we would become best friends and at the same moment I stopped to think "what if I fall in love with her...did I make a mistake?" Well, you can fall in love with your best friend, don't think about repercussions just yet. And yes, our first day was a decent, normal day...we went home and I was so delighted to know that she stays in the same town as mine. To keep things real, lets just say it was not love at first sight...I fell in love with her two weeks into our friendship.
